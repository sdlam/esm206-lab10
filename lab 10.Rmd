## beepr beeps

Use the function `beep()` in the beeper package to make an audio alert when your code is done running. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (i in rev(seq(1:999))) {
  
  print(paste(i, "bottles of beer on the wall")) #for loop - iterates function for each value in a sequence 
  
}

#beep(4)
```

#Praise and cowsay 

packages built with a single purpose: to be kind and fun. 

```{r}
praise("${Exclamation}, ${EXCLAMATION}...${exclamation}!!!!")

praise("Holy ${creating}, Batman - this code is ${ADJECTIVE}!")
```

Use cowsay::say() to make a character say something to you. 

```{r}

```
